## 🔌 How the App Works (Connection Overview)

The application stays "live" by constantly talking to the database:
- **Login**: When you enter your mobile/password, the app checks the database and gives you a digital "key" (token) to stay logged in.
- **Dynamic Stats**: Every time you open a page, the app calls the backend to get the latest meal counts and billing figures.
- **Owner-Student Sync**: When an owner marks an absence in the "Attendance" section, it immediately updates the "Remaining Meals" on that student's dashboard.
- **Payments**: The student's "Pay" button uses a secure UPI link that pre-fills your unique UPI ID for error-free transactions.

---

## 🛑 Prerequisites (One-Time Setup)

Before running the application, you need to install two things. **Do this only once.**

### Step 1: Install Node.js (The Engine)

Node.js is the software that runs the application.

1. Visit **[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)**
2. Download the **LTS Version** (the big green button)
3. Run the downloaded file and click **Continue/Next** until finished

**Verify installation:**
Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type:
```bash
node --version
```
You should see something like `v20.10.0`

---

### Step 2: Set Up MongoDB (The Database)

The database stores all your data (students, bills, attendance).

#### Option A: MongoDB Atlas (Recommended - Free Cloud Database)

1. Visit **[mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)**
2. Click **Try Free** and create an account
3. Create a **Free Shared Cluster** (M0 tier)
4. Under **Security → Database Access**: Create a database user with password
5. Under **Security → Network Access**: Click "Add IP Address" → "Allow Access from Anywhere"
6. Under **Deployments**: Click **Connect** → **Connect your application**
7. Copy the connection string (looks like: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.xxx.mongodb.net/`)

#### Option B: Local MongoDB (Advanced)

1. Download **MongoDB Community Server** from [mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
2. Install and run it as a service
3. Your connection string will be: `mongodb://localhost:27017/mess_db`

---

### Step 3: Configure the Application

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder inside your project
2. Create a file called `.env` (note the dot at the start)
3. Add the following content:

```env
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
JWT_SECRET=any_random_long_text_here_for_security
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001
```

**Example with MongoDB Atlas:**
```env
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://myuser:mypassword123@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net/mess_db?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey123randomtext456
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Replace `myuser`, `mypassword123`, and the cluster URL with your actual MongoDB Atlas credentials.

---

## 🚀 Starting the Application

### Method 1: Using the Magic Script (Recommended)

This script will start both the backend and frontend for you.

1. **Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)**.
2. **Navigate to the project folder**.
3. **Run the Python script**:
   ```bash
   python3 start_all.py
   ```
   *(If `python3` doesn't work, try just `python`)*.

### Method 2: Using NPM (Alternative)

If you have Node.js installed, you can use this simple command:

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**.
2. **Navigate to the project folder**.
3. **Run**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Method 3: Manual Start (Advanced)

If the scripts don't work, start each part manually:

#### Terminal 1 - Start Backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
node seed.js
npm run server
```

#### Terminal 2 - Start Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting FAQ

### "npm is not recognized" / "node is not recognized"

**Cause:** Node.js is not installed properly.  
**Solution:** Reinstall Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and restart your Terminal.

---

### "MongoNetworkError" / "Database Connection Failed"

**Cause:** Cannot connect to MongoDB.  
**Solution:**
1. Check if your internet is working
2. Verify the `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env` is correct
3. Make sure you allowed network access in MongoDB Atlas (Security → Network Access → Allow from Anywhere)

---

### "Address already in use" (Port 5000 or 3000)

**Cause:** The application is already running or another app is using that port.  
**Solution:**

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# Kill process on port 5000
lsof -i :5000 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9

# Kill process on port 3000
lsof -i :3000 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
```

**Windows:**
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F
```

Or simply: **Restart your computer**.

---

### "CORS Error" / "Network Error"

**Cause:** Backend and Frontend are not communicating properly.  
**Solution:**
1. Make sure the backend is running (Terminal should show "Server running")
2. Check that `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `.env` includes `http://localhost:3000`
3. Access via `localhost`, not an IP address

---

### The page is blank / shows loading forever

**Cause:** Frontend is still compiling or the backend is down.  
**Solution:**
1. Wait 10-15 seconds on first load
2. Check if backend terminal shows any errors
3. Try refreshing the page (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R`)

---

### "Invalid mobile or password"

**Cause:** Wrong credentials or user doesn't exist.  
**Solution:**
- Owner: Mobile `9999999999`, Password `admin123`
- Re-run the seed script: `cd backend && node seed.js`

---

### How do I stop the application?

Go to the Terminal window and press **Ctrl + C**.
